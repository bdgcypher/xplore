# Xplore - React Travel Application
Xplore is a travel website frontend built to showcase my skill in creating beautiful and responsive React applications. This complete website frontend allows users to explore various travel destinations and vacation deals. The application features 10+ pages including a homepage with featured destinations, an about page with information about the "company", a destinations page with all available locations, and individual trip pages for each destination.

The user interface was designed using Tailwind CSS, which provides easy-to-use and responsive CSS styling. In addition, Tailwind UI components were used to speed up the development process and provide a more professional look.
